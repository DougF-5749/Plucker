# üê¶ Plucker üê¶
A comedic bird identification app (with a twist) created as a **two-week**, **choose-anything** project during the final phase of **Makers Academy bootcamp**. Our group wanted to **consolidate our learnings**, especially around back-end/ front-end integration and asynchronous Python.

 ‚ö†Ô∏è _**The creators of this app do not actually condone cooking random birds (no matter how tasty they look). Read on for more context...**_ ‚ö†Ô∏è

## Overview
Plucker allows users to upload photos of birds, record sightings (species, location), and provides a randonly selected recipe for that bird. 

This project helped us bridge the gap between frontend and backend, practice asynchronous Flask usage, and experiment with building a more robust application than our previous bootcamp projects.

## Context and Motivation
- We had **two weeks** to create _anything_ we wanted.
  
- As a group, we decided to **focus on technologies** or concepts we felt we **hadn‚Äôt fully mastered** (e.g., concurrency, async in Python).
  
- Our **original plan** included uploading images to a Google Image API for auto-identification, plus using GPS services for location data.
  - **MVP Approach**: For this two-week sprint, we scaled back: the user manually enters the bird‚Äôs name and location.
  - **Tasty Feature**: Generates a ‚Äúrecipe‚Äù (again, do not condone...) for the bird every time a new sighting is recorded.

- **Async & Concurrency**: We wanted to adapt our Flask app (originally a WSGI) to handle **async requests** from the JavaScript frontend by using Hypercorn (an ASGI server) and asyncio.
  - This was **challenging** since Flask itself is not inherently ASGI, but I **learned a lot** about **WSGI vs. ASGI frameworks**.
  
- My frontend involvement was relatively light as I was the main contributor for the backend of the app.
  
- We prioritised learning asynchronous back-end techniques and ensuring some test coverage.
  
- **Test coverage** is decent on the backend, though not 100%. That‚Äôs an area for future improvement.

## Features
- **Bird Sighting Recording**: Users can create new sightings, specifying the bird species and location.
  
- **Random Recipe Generato**r: On each upload, the app returns a comedic ‚Äúrecipe‚Äù (do not try at home!).
  
- **Frontend / Backend Integration**: With React on the client side and a Python/Flask server, data flows asynchronously.
  
- **Async**: Used Hypercorn and asyncio to handle concurrency, even though Flask is traditionally synchronous.
  
- **PostgreSQL**: Robust relational DB to store sighting data.
  
- **Group Collaboration**: Employed agile methodologies (kanban boards, daily stand-ups, pair programming) over the two-week timeframe.

## Installation and Setup

1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the repository (your fork):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/plucker.git
cd plucker
```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Set up the backend:

- Install Python 3 and PostgreSQL if you don‚Äôt have them already.

- Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # on Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```
- Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Configure the database:

- Create a local PostgreSQL DB (e.g., plucker).
- Update config or .env variables to point to your DB (username, password, etc.).

4Ô∏è‚É£ Set up the front-end:

- Navigate to the frontend folder:

```bash
cd client
npm install
```

5Ô∏è‚É£ Run the application:

- Backend:
```bash
hypercorn app:app --reload
```
- Frontend:
```bash
npm start
```
- Access the app in your browser at http://localhost:3000 (or whichever port you configured).

## Impactful Commits

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ [database design and seed data](https://github.com/DougF-5749/Plucker/commit/2fb293dec3cbeedf5518b76e56b5dcbec596a0e0)

- This schema is designed for an application where users track bird sightings, and each sighting generates one recipe. Those recipes, in turn, are broken down into ingredients, steps, and ratings.

- To facilitate quick testing, several rows are inserted into each table. This seeded data ensures that we can immediately run queries and evaluate the schema‚Äôs functionality without having to create everything manually.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ [db_connection setup](https://github.com/DougF-5749/Plucker/commit/ba244e6308ea69737601f7cc94fb744fffc8fb51)
- I removed psycopg2 from the requirements and replaced it with asyncpg, allowing the project to use an asynchronous database connection to manage interactions with the database.

- Instead of synchronously opening and closing connections for every request, we benefit from better performance and scalability when handling multiple concurrent requests.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ [Recipe Template and Service Layer](https://github.com/DougF-5749/Plucker/commit/e2417a836594ba6bf32da5ef5ac8156d9ce8aa4d)

**Recipe Templates:**

- Early on, the project needed a quick way to generate recipes before we could integrate with an AI API for dynamic recipe generation. As an MVP (Minimum Viable Product) solution, we decided to **hardcode recipe templates** (eventually 11). One of the first examples was **HERB_GLAZED_RECIPE**
 
- A standardised template ensures every recipe has a clear format (title, cooking time, ingredients, steps) that **aligned with the database design**.

- The **placeholder {BIRD}** lets us easily adapt this base template for any bird name

- While the final goal was to generate recipes on-the-fly via an AI API (with a carefully crafted prompt), **time constraints** led us to maintain a random selection of hardcoded recipes.

**Service Layer:**

- I learned that basic CRUD operations should live in repository files, while higher-level application logic belongs in a **service layer**. This ensures each layer has a clear responsibility.
  
- I created a **RecipeService class** to handle higher-level functionality like creating a recipe based on a bird sighting.
  - This service depends on repositories for data operations (e.g., saving sightings, recipes, ingredients, steps).
  - It abstracts the flow of creating a recipe (which span multiple tables) into a single method (**_create_recipe_from_bird_name_**).
 
- A **helper function** (**_populate_bird_template_**) inserts the bird name into a predefined recipe template (e.g HERB_GLAZED_RECIPE).

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ [Blue print for route abstraction](https://github.com/DougF-5749/Plucker/commit/01f3e58aa1d2568e7104e99b4ab291d75a42058c)
- This commit is an exmplae of how I abstracted routes into their own routes directory instead of defining routes directly in app.py.

- Each set of related endpoints is organised within a Flask Blueprint. The main app.py file then calls app.register_blueprint() to link these routes together. This avoids clutter in app.py, making it easier to maintain and locate specific endpoints.

- As the project grows, new features (e.g. authentication, recipe endpoints, etc.) can each have their own Blueprint. This pattern reduces merge conflicts and promotes modular development.
